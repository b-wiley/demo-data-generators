# Demo Data Generators

There are several scripts that will generate data, which can be used for testing data activation.  Examples of data that can be generated from these scripts:
- User data
- App subscription event data
- App transaction event data

All scripts are designed so that they can be joined together via SQL or other data engineering / science processes.
